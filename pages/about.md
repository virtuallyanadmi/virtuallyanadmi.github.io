My name is Jonathan Stewart.

I currently serve as a Sr Systems Engineer for the Cloud Solutions Management department at Enterprise Holdings Inc. Basically, I am a design engineer for "the largest car rental service provider in the world measured by revenue, employees and fleet".

I have been married to my beautiful wife, Beth since 1997. I am also a father of three great children, Jordi, Elexa and Jensen.

I am a Colorado native living in Missouri, married to a Missourian. I have been involved with some sort of IT for about 25 years. I built my first computer when I was 15 (1990 and it was a 286). I currently have the following certifications: CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, Project+; Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE); Microsoft Certified Information Technology Professional: Enterprise Administrator (MCITP:EA); and VMware Certified Professional (VCP4 and VCP5).
