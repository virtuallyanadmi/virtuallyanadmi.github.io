My name is Jonathan Stewart.

I currently serve as a Manager of the Product Development team in the x86 Services department at Enterprise Holdings Inc. Basically, I am managing several design engineers that manage the internal private clouds for "the largest car rental service provider in the world measured by revenue, employees and fleet".

I have been married to my beautiful wife, Beth since 1997. I am also a father of three great children, Jordi, Elexa and Jensen.

I have been serving as one of the co-leaders for the St. Louis VMware User Group for the past couple of years. Also, I am a two-time vExpert and was awarded Cisco Champion for the 2016 year.

I am a Colorado native living in Missouri, married to a Missourian. I have been involved with some sort of IT for about 25 years. I built my first computer when I was 15 (1990 and it was a 286). I currently have the following certifications: CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, Project+; Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE); Microsoft Certified Information Technology Professional: Enterprise Administrator (MCITP:EA); and VMware Certified Professional (VCP4 and VCP5).
