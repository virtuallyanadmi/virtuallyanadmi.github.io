Sometimes life throws you curveballs. Such has been the case the last couple of weeks.

A little over two weeks ago, I came home and could not get warm. By bedtime that night, I had developed a fever. My fever broke in the middle of the night and I woke up in a pool of sweat. This continued for 5 days. On day 6, I was going to go to the doctor as I was tired of having a fever. However, no fever came so I was relieved. Then the coughing and tightness in my chest started. I should have gone to the doctor and in fact had my wife call my primary physician. Unfortunately, they could not fit me in and so I had to wait until this past Monday to see the doctor.

Well, while being sick, I recieved an award I was not expecting. It started by an email I recieved talking about a Cisco Champion radio webcast. I was a little confused as to why I was invited to it. Being sick probably contributed to this confusion. Then I checked my Promotions tab in gmail and low and behold, I had recieved an email from Cisco Champions PMO welcoming me as a 2016 Cisco Champion.

This award took me by surprise as I had forgotten I had put in my application back in the fall. In fact, I believe I told some of my friends that I did not remember filling out the application. Well after checking my email, I had indeed filled out the application and am humbled to be selected to the Cisco Champions program.

Then, this morning, I checked the twitter feed and low and behold there was the announcement for the 2016 vExperts. I checked the site and there I was on the list.

So I went from not feeling well because of being sick to being honored and humbled to be selected to not one but two awards.

I want to continue to provide relevant posts and links to the IT community. I anticipate great things in 2016 and even though it seemed to start rough with the long sickness, I am excited to see what will come out of being part of these two great communities.
