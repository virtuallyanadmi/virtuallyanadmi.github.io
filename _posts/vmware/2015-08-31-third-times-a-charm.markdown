They say that third times a charm. I guess that is true. Last week, I was awarded as a [2015 vExpert](https://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/vexpert?src=vmw_so_vex_jstew_1014). This award is given to a select few who have given back to the VMware community. I am humbled that I was selected but proud of what I have been able to do in the community and hope to do more.

Some of you may know that I am one of the co-leaders of the [St. Louis VMware User Group](https://www.vmug.com/index.php?mo=cm&op=ld&fid=217&gid=193). I [tweet](http://twitter.com/virtuallyanadmi), post on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/virtuallyanadmi) and lead quarterly meetings (including the one coming up in [September](https://www.vmug.com/p/cm/ld/fid=11401), don't forget to register!). I am a firm believer in what [VMware](http://www.vmware.com?src=vmw_so_vex_jstew_1014) in what they produce and where they are going.

If you missed the [keynote](http://www.vmworld.com/en/index.html#4455051811001) this morning at [VMWorld](http://www.vmworld.com?src=vmw_so_vex_jstew_1014), VMware showcased cross-cloud vMotion, Containerization, and further progress on the Software Defined Datacenter (SDDC). I encourage you to watch it.

I look forward to what is in store the next year as I learn more and I hope to give back even more to this community.
