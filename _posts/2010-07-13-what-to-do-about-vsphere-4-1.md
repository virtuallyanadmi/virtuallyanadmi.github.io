The release does provide some neat features such as being able to add your ESX or ESXi server to Active Directory allowing for domain login into the servers. But another feature is that the upgrade for vCenter only runs on 64-bit Windows OS which makes transitioning to the new vCenter a little bit of a hassle.
Thankfully, VMware has provided some [kb articles](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1021635) on how to migrate the database to the new vCenter.
For where I work. We will probably wait a little bit before making the migration. But that is ok. I will make another post on how it went when we do migrate.
