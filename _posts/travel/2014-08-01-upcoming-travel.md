First, it will be a good time to see the new products that VMware and others are going to be putting out this coming year.

Secondly, I get to see my brother, Bryce. His company is sending him to it as well. He is a Network Engineer out in the Denver area and so I don't get to see him a lot. I will get to see him again in September when our brother Royce gets married. That will be fun too, but it will be fun to see him and be able to talk geek-speak without our wives rolling their eyes at us.

Finally, I am looking forward to going out to San Francisco as this will be my first time there too. If you have any recommendations on where to eat or what to see, let me know.

Well, I will try to update on VMworld while I am there. No promises though as I do have a busy schedule while I am there.
