As part of the VCE vBlock, the Unified Infrastructure Manager -Provisioning (UIM/P) is used to provision out the hardware and can help in the automation of this type of provisioning. The UIM/P is a virtual appliance that can be deployed into a vCenter environment.

## Installation

  1. Take a snapshot of the UIM/P appliance, using vSphere Client.
{% include alert warning='A snapshot of the UIM/P appliance is important in order to prevent loss of data and allow proper rollback if an error occurs during the upgrade.' %}

  2. Use vSphere Client to mount the UIMP-4.0.0.2.xxx-Update-Media.iso file to the UIM/P appliance. In this instance, the file is located on the D: drive under ISO’s/UIM.[![UIMP ISO](/images/UIM1.png)](/images/UIM1.png)


  3. In a supported browser, type the following URL into the address bar: [https://IPofUIMPappliance:5480](https://IP of UIMP Appliance:5480/).
