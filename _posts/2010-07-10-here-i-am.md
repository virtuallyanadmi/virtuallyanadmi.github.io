So, I started this blog to basically be a diary of the life of an IT Manager. But unlike some, I still dig into the technology part of things. Though I try not to meddle to much, I am the only VCP on our staff so I do have to get my hands dirty every once in a while. I still enjoy doing this but I also understand that if the team relies upon me to do it, no one will learn how to do it. Thus I might use this blog to help them out as well.

We'll see....
