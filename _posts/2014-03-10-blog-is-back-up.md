What you may not have seen is that I migrated my blog back off of AWS to a home server running LAMP and Wordpress. But in the past year and half, we have attempted to buy a house and were able to move into it. But it fell through, so we had to find another house to buy and we did.

Through all of this transition, the hard drive that this blog was being hosted on, crashed. I did not replace it until this past Friday night and have spent the last couple of days getting everything back up and going. So here we are.

In the coming blog posts, expect a review of my job change as well as some helps in managing the VCE vBlock Suite, which is now part of my job. I am looking forward to posting some of these howto's and really start blogging more often.
