Here is what the UPS looked like a couple of weeks ago:

Everything looked fine and the load wasn't too bad at that time. I happened to check it a couple of days ago and the load had jumped to 95%.
Tonight, my daughter opened the door to the basement and where my home lab is and there was this high pitching noise. Turns out, it was the UPS. So I checked out the status on my router and it was showing an error that stated ONLINE BATTERY REPLACEMENT. What else could I do but find a new UPS or battery to replace it.
Thankfully my wife was already out an about so I checked the prices of both a new battery and a new UPS. I found one that was close to what my model was at Best Buy and sent her over there to pick it up. She arrived home and I was able to replace the bad one. Here is what the new one looks like:

So home lab is back up.
