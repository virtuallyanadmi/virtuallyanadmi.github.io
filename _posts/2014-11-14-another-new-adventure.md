It seems that 2014 has been a year of changes. A lot of people whom I follow on social media seemed to have changed jobs or roles this year. I made a change in companies back in January. I took a new job as a Sr. Systems Engineer for Enterprise Holdings Inc. They are the parent company of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, National Car Rental and Alamo Rent A Car. I was part of the Cloud Solutions Management team. I got to use my experience in HP, Cisco, and VMware to help support and build upon their offerings.

Well fast forward to two weeks ago. I was told, I was moving to a new team. Essentially moving from internal cloud support to the external cloud support.
What does this mean? Well I have built up my scripting skills the last couple of years to help automate tasks and repetitive jobs. I have learned Powershell pretty well and can move in and out of it. Lately, I have been focusing on vCenter Orchestrator and it uses javascript as its programming language.

With my new role, I will be learning python, utilizing git, and more than likely json. I will be learning how to manage Infrastructure as a Code now. In this new role, I will be a Cloud Engineer. I will be on the team that works with Amazon Web Services (AWS). So expect some articles on AWS in the coming months as I learn, I am going to try to write about this new adventure.
